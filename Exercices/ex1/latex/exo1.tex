\exercice{ADT and classes: The Dispenser example}

Given the small test program implementing an ADT STACK[G] as seen during the lecture. It contains the following classes and interfaces in the \texttt{dispenser} package:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \texttt{Dispenser.java} interface.
 \item \texttt{DispenserTest.java} main class.
 \item \texttt{ArrayStack.java} class in the sub-package \texttt{stack}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Create a NetBeans project with the provided classes~\cite{WEBGL}.
 \item Test the program and get familiar with it.
 \item In the \texttt{stack} package add at least one other implementation, by extending the \texttt{Dispenser} interface, simulating a stack (LIFO).
 \item In the \texttt{queue} package add at least one other implementation, by extending the \texttt{Dispenser} interface, simulating a queue (FIFO).
 \item Modify the \texttt{DispenserTest} class accordingly.
 \item Improve the whole application with feature you judge necessary.
\end{enumerate}
